# mlb-run-predictor
This application gets the MLB match ups for the day and lets the user select one. When that is done it request a Google Cloud Platform API for predictions of each teams runs for that game. That API is a trained Machine Learning model that is deployed on [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/getting-started) and any one can deploy it by following the instruction in [this repositpory](https://github.com/sethvanb/SpringBoard). You must deploy the Machine Learning model in order to use this application. 

[Heroku Deployment](https://mlb-run-predictor.herokuapp.com/)

## Deployment Instructions
* clone this repository to your local machine
* add gcp-credentails.json (This can only be generated by the admin who deployed the model to Google Cloud Platform, read above to deplpoy the model yourself)
  * if you deploy the machine learning model to Google Cloud Platform youself then you will also need to edit the server/infrence.py file on line 238, replace project id, region, model name, and version, instances can be left alone
* Follow [these instructions](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#for-a-new-app) to deploy the app on Heroku 
  * To perform this step you will need to have a Heroku account and you will need to install and login to the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
  * I choose Heroku because it is free but the application can be modified to work on other application deployment platforms
* Run in terminal`heroku config:set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=gcp-credentials.json`
 * this will set a Config Var on your heroku app for the Google Cloud Platform credentials
 * You may have to redeploy your heroku app after this
